Leaflet.DistortableImage
===================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/publiclab/Leaflet.DistortableImage.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/publiclab/Leaflet.DistortableImage)
[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/leaflet-distortableimage.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/leaflet-distortableimage)

A Leaflet extension to distort images -- "rubbersheeting" -- for the [MapKnitter.org](http://mapknitter.org) ([src](https://github.com/publiclab/mapknitter)) image georectification service by [Public Lab](http://publiclab.org). Leaflet.DistortableImage allows for perspectival distortions of images, client-side, using CSS3 transformations in the DOM.

Advantages include:

* It can handle over 100 images smoothly, even on a smartphone.
* Images can be right-clicked and downloaded individually in their original state
* CSS3 transforms are GPU-accelerated in most (all?) browsers, for a very smooth UI
* No need to server-side generate raster GeoTiffs, tilesets, etc. in order to view distorted imagery layers
* Images use DOM event handling for real-time distortion
* [Full resolution download option](https://github.com/publiclab/Leaflet.DistortableImage/pull/100) for large images, using WebGL acceleration

[Download as zip](https://github.com/publiclab/Leaflet.DistortableImage/releases) or clone the repo to get a local copy.

Also available [on NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/leaflet-distortableimage) as `leaflet-distortableimage`

The recommended Google satellite base layer can be integrated using this Leaflet plugin: https://gitlab.com/IvanSanchez/Leaflet.GridLayer.GoogleMutant

Here's a screenshot:

## Setup - Single Image Interface

1. From the root directory, run `npm install` or `sudo npm install`

2. Open `examples/index.html` in a browser

## Demo

Check out this [simple demo](https://publiclab.github.io/Leaflet.DistortableImage/examples/index.html).

And watch this GIF demo:

![demo gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/publiclab/mapknitter/master/public/demo.gif)

To test the code, open `index.html` in your browser and click and drag the markers on the edges of the image. The image will show perspectival distortions.

## Basic Usage

The most simple implementation to get started:

```js
// basic Leaflet map setup
map = L.map('map').setView([51.505, -0.09], 13);
L.tileLayer('https://{s}.tiles.mapbox.com/v3/anishshah101.ipm9j6em/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {
  maxZoom: 18,
  attribution: 'Map data &copy; <a href="http://openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors, ' +
    '<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">CC-BY-SA</a>, ' +
    'Imagery Â© <a href="http://mapbox.com">Mapbox</a>',
  id: 'examples.map-i86knfo3'
}).addTo(map);

// create an image
img = L.distortableImageOverlay(
  'example.png', {
    // 'corners' is the only required option for this class
    // and is in NW, NE, SW, SE order
    corners: [
      L.latLng(51.52,-0.14),
      L.latLng(51.52,-0.10),
      L.latLng(51.50,-0.14),
      L.latLng(51.50,-0.10)
    ],
  }).addTo(map);

// enable editing
L.DomEvent.on(img._image, 'load', img.editing.enable, img.editing);
```

Options available to pass during `L.DistortableImageOverlay` initialization:

- [actions](#Actions)

- [corners](#corners)

- [selected](#selected)

- [mode](#mode)

- [fullResolutionSrc](#Full-resolution%20download)

- [keymapper](#keymapper)

- [suppressToolbar](#Suppress-Toolbar)


### Actions 

- `actions` (*optional*, default: [ToggleTransparency, ToggleOutline, ToggleLock, ToggleRotateScale, ToggleOrder, EnableEXIF, Restore, Export, Delete], value: *array*)

If you would like to overrwrite the default toolbar actions available for an individual image's `L.Popup` toolbar, pass an array with the actions you want. Reference the available values [here](#Single-Image-Interface).

For example, to overrwrite the toolbar to only include the `ToggleTransparency` and `Delete` actions:

``` JS
img = L.distortableImageOverlay(
*   'example.png', {
    // 'corners' is the only required option for this class
    // and is in NW, NE, SW, SE order
    corners: [
      L.latLng(51.52,-0.14),
      L.latLng(51.52,-0.10),
      L.latLng(51.50,-0.14),
      L.latLng(51.50,-0.10)
    ],
    actions: [ToggleTransparency, Delete]
  }).addTo(map);
```

### Corners

The corners are stored as `L.latLng` objects on the image, and can be accessed using 
our `getCorners()` method after the image is instantiated and added to the map. 
They are provided in `NW, NE, SW, SE` order (in a `Z` shape).

Useful usage example:

```js
// instantiate, add to map and enable
img = L.distortableImageOverlay(...);
img.addTo(map);
L.DomEvent.on(img._image, 'load', img.editing.enable, img.editing);

// grab the initial corner positions
JSON.stringify(img.getCorners())
=> "[{"lat":51.52,"lng":-0.14},{"lat":51.52,"lng":-0.1},{"lat":51.5,"lng":-0.14},{"lat":51.5,"lng":-0.1}]"

// ...move the image around...

// check the new corner positions.
JSON.stringify(img.getCorners())
=> "[{"lat":51.50685099607552,"lng":-0.06058305501937867},{"lat":51.50685099607552,"lng":-0.02058595418930054},{"lat":51.486652692081925,"lng":-0.06058305501937867},{"lat":51.486652692081925,"lng":-0.02058595418930054}]"

// note there is an added level of precision after dragging the image for debugging purposes
```
We further added a `getCorner(idx)` method used the same way as its plural counterpart but with an index passed to it.

### Selected

`selected` (*optional*, default: false, value: *boolean*)

By default, your image will initially appear on the screen as "unselected", meaning its toolbar and editing handles will not be visible. Interacting with the image, such as by clicking it, will make these components visible.

Some developers prefer that an image initially appears as "selected" instead of "unselected". In this case, we provide an option to pass `selected: true`.

Note: when working with the multi image interface, only the last overlay you pass `selected: true` to will appear with editing handles _and_ a toolbar.

### Mode

`mode` (*optional*, default: "distort", value: *string*)

Each primary editing mode corresponds to a separate editing handle.

This option sets the image's initial editing mode, meaning the corresponding editing handle will always appear first when you interact with the image.

Values available to pass to `mode` are: 

- #### distort (_default_)

  - Distortion via individually draggable corners.

- #### rotate

  - Rotation only.

- #### scale

  - Resize only. 

- #### rotateScale:

  - Free transform. Combines the `rotate` and `scale` modes into one.

- #### lock:

  - Prevents any image actions (including those triggered from the toolbar, user gestures, and hotkeys) until the toolbar action [ToggleLock](#ToggleLock-(<kbd>l</kbd>)) is explicitly triggered (or its hotkey <kbd>l</kbd>).

In the below example, the image will be initialiazed with "rotateScale" handles:

```js
// create an image
  img = L.distortableImageOverlay("example.png", {
    corners: [
      L.latLng(51.52, -0.14),
      L.latLng(51.52, -0.10),
      L.latLng(51.50, -0.14),
      L.latLng(51.50, -0.10)
    ],
    mode: "rotateScale",
  }).addTo(map);

L.DomEvent.on(img._image, 'load', img.editing.enable, img.editing);
```

### Keymapper

`keymapper` (*optional*, default: true, value: *boolean*)

By default, an image loads with a keymapper legend showing the available key bindings for different editing / interaction options. To suppress the keymapper, pass `keymapper: false` as an additional option to the image.

### Full-resolution download

We've added a GPU-accelerated means to generate a full resolution version of the distorted image; it requires two additional dependencies to enable; see how we've included them in the demo:

```HTML
<script src="../node_modules/webgl-distort/dist/webgl-distort.js"></script>
<script src="../node_modules/glfx/glfx.js"></script>
```

When instantiating a Distortable Image, pass in a `fullResolutionSrc` option set to the url of the higher resolution image. This image will be used in full-res exporting.

```JS
// create basic map setup from above

// create an image - note the optional
// fullResolutionSrc option is now passed in
img = L.distortableImageOverlay(
  'example.png', {
    corners: [
      L.latLng(51.52,-0.14),
      L.latLng(51.52,-0.10),
      L.latLng(51.50,-0.14),
      L.latLng(51.50,-0.10)
    ],
    fullResolutionSrc: 'large.jpg'
  }).addTo(map);

L.DomEvent.on(img._image, 'load', img.editing.enable, img.editing);
```

### Suppress Toolbar

`suppressToolbar` (*optional*, default: false, value: *boolean*)

To initialize an image without its toolbar, pass it `suppressToolbar: true`. 

Typically, editing actions are triggered through our toolbar interface or our predefined keybindings. If disabling the toolbar, the developer will need to implement their own toolbar UI or just use the keybindings. (WIP API for doing this)

This option will override other options related to the toolbar, such as [`selected: true`](#Selected)

## Setup - Multiple Image Interface

1.  From the root directory, run `npm install` or `sudo npm install`

2.  Open `examples/select.html` in a browser (todo -- add gh pages demo)

Our `DistortableCollection` class allows working with multiple images simultaneously. This interface builds on the single image interface.

The setup is relatively similar - here is an example with two images:

```JS
// 1. Instantiate map
// 2. Instantiate images but this time *dont* add them directly to the map
img = L.distortableImageOverlay(
  'example.png', {
    keymapper: false,
    corners: [
      L.latLng(51.52, -0.14),
      L.latLng(51.52,-0.10),
      L.latLng(51.50, -0.14),
      L.latLng(51.50,-0.10)
    ],
  });

img2 = L.distortableImageOverlay(
  'example.png', {
    keymapper: false,
    corners: [
      L.latLng(51.51, -0.20),
      L.latLng(51.51,-0.16),
      L.latLng(51.49, -0.21),
      L.latLng(51.49,-0.17)
    ],
});

// 3. Instantiate an empty `DistortableCollection` group
imgGroup = L.distortableCollection().addTo(map);

// 4. Add the images to the group 
imgGroup.addLayer(img);
imgGroup.addLayer(img2);
```

<blockquote><strong>Note</strong>: notice how we didn't <code>enable</code> the image editing above as we had done for the single image interface. This is because our <code>DistortableCollection</code> class uses event listeners internally (<code>layeradd</code>) to enable editing on every image as it's added. This event is only triggered if we add the layers to the group dynamically. I.e. you must add the group to the map initially empty.</blockquote>

Options available to pass during `L.DistortableCollection` initialization: 

- [actions](#â¤-Actions)

### â¤ Actions

- `actions` (*optional*, default: [Exports, Deletes, Locks, Unlocks], value: *array*)

Overrwrite the default toolbar actions for an image collection's `L.Control` toolbar. Reference the available values [here](#Multiple-Image-Interface).

For example, to overrwrite the toolbar to only include the `Deletes` action:

```JS
imgGroup = L.distortableCollection({
  actions: [Deletes]
}).addTo(map);
```

To add / remove a tool from the toolbar at runtime, we have also added the methods `addTool(action)` and `removeTool(action)`.

### UI and functionalities 
Currently it supports multiple image selection and translations, and WIP we are working on porting all editing tools to work for it, such as transparency, etc. Image distortions still use the single-image interface.

**How to multi-select:**
  1. Multi-selection works with <kbd>cmd</kbd> + `click` to toggle an individual image's inclusion in this interface.
  2. Or <kbd>shift</kbd> + `drag` to use our `BoxSelector` handler to select multiple at once.
  3. Or for touch devices, `touch` and `hold` (aka `longpress`). 

  **How to un-multi-select:**
  - A single toolbar instance (using `L.control`) renders the set of tools available to use on collections of images.
  - In order to return to the single-image interface, where each `L.popup` toolbar only applies actions on the image it's attached to, you must toggle *all* images out of multi-select or...
  - ...Click on the map or hit the <kbd>esc</kbd> key to quickly deselect all images.
  - For the aforementioned 3 mutli-select methods, the `BoxSelector` method is the only one that doesn't also toggle _out_ of multi-select mode.

## Toolbar Actions (& Keybindings)

<hr>

### Single Image Interface:

<hr>

Defaults:

- **ToggleLock (<kbd>l</kbd>)**

  - Toggles between [lock mode](#lock) and [distort mode](#distort-(_default_)).

- **ToggleRotateScale (<kbd>r</kbd>, <kbd>d</kbd>)**

  - Toggles between [rotateScale](#rotateScale) and [distort mode](#distort-(_default_)).


- **ToggleOrder (<kbd>j</kbd>, <kbd>k</kbd>)**

  - If you have multiple images, use this to switch an individual image's overlap back and forth into view. Employs [`bringToFront()`](https://leafletjs.com/reference-1.5.0.html\#imageoverlay-bringtofront) and [`bringToBack()`](https://leafletjs.com/reference-1.5.0.html#imageoverlay-bringtoback) from the Leaflet API.

- **ToggleOutline (<kbd>o</kbd>)**

- **ToggleTransparency (<kbd>t</kbd>)**

- **EnableEXIF (WIP)**

- **Restore**

  - Restores the image to its original proportions and scale, but keeps its current rotation angle and location on the map intact.

- **Export**

- **Delete (<kbd>delete</kbd>, <kbd>backscpace</kbd>)**

  - Permanently deletes the image from the map.

 Addons:

- **ToggleRotate** (<kbd>caps lock</kbd>):

  - Toggles between [rotate mode](#rotate) and [distort mode](#distort-(_default_)).
  - Replaced as a default toolbar action by `ToggleRotateScale`, but still accessible via its hotkey, `mode`, and (WIP) custom toolbar actions API.


- **ToggleScale** (<kbd>s</kbd>):

  - Toggles between [scale mode](#scale) and [distort mode](#distort-(_default_)).
  - Replaced as a default toolbar action by `ToggleRotateScale`, but still accessible via its hotkey, `mode`, and (WIP) custom toolbar actions API.

## Contributing

This plugin has basic functionality, and is in production as part of MapKnitter, but there are [plenty of outstanding issues to resolve](https://github.com/publiclab/Leaflet.DistortableImage/issues). Please consider helping out!

1) This project uses `grunt` to do a lot of things, including concatenate source files from `/src/` to `/DistortableImageOverlay.js`:

```Bash
#you may need to install grunt-cli first:
$ npm install -g grunt-cli

#run in root dir, and it'll watch for changes and concatenate them on the fly
$ grunt
```

2) To build all files from `/src/` into the `/dist/` folder, run:

```Bash
$ grunt concat:dist
```

3. _Optional_: We use SVG for our icon system. Please visit our wiki [SVG Icon System](https://github.com/publiclab/Leaflet.DistortableImage/wiki/SVG-Icon-System) if you are interested in making updates to them or just simply learning about our workflow.
